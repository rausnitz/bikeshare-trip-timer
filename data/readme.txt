The trip data CSV file contains four columns.
The first column identifies each unique pair of stations between which trips were taken.
The second says how many trips members took between the stations in 2013.
The third shows how many of those trips were more than four times as long as the shortest trip taken between that pair of stations.
The fourth shows the average (mean) duration of trips that were not more than four times as long as the shortest trip.

The station information is publicly available here: http://capitalbikeshare.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml.

The trip data used in the Trip Timer is publicly available here: http://capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data.
